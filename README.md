# About

A simple app where you get a screenshot from an arbitrary episode from the Stargate franchise (SG-1, SGA & SGU) and your objective is to pinpoint the series, season, and episode from which that screenshot is from.

There is a concept of a daily, where according to UTC time everyone around the globe gets the same screenshot to guess.

You can find it hosted at [http://stargate.smolik.xyz/](http://stargate.smolik.xyz/).
